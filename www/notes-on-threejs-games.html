# How To Write Three.js Games

This pages is notes about how to do games with three.js.

From [github issue #53](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex/issues/53)

## How To Make Sounds

In Short, use [Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html). 
You can use [WebAudiox](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/webaudiox) helpers if you want. It helps
a for for best practices and sounds localisations. So when a monster on my left yells i want to 
hear it on the left.



## How To Do UI

In Short, use the DOM itself for that. Dont recode it in canvas 2d or WebGL.
You can look at [marbletable2](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/marbletable2/).


## User Identification

Nothings specific is provided. 
Maybe good idea if you use external services for that, it avoid to redo the same thing
over and over. Maybe [passport.js](http://passportjs.org/) is a good idea.
